# Data Scientist Dataset EDA and Recommendations

## Introduction

Data science jobs are in high demand and experiencing significant growth in the technology industry. As the demand for data science skills continues to increase, there is a shortage of professionals with analytical skills. This shortage presents an opportunity for individuals and companies to enter the field of data science and data analysis.

## Problem Statement

The goal of this project is to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset related to data scientists. By exploring the dataset's features, we aim to derive actionable observations and provide overall recommendations that will benefit anyone or any company interested in the field of data science and data analysis.

The following areas will be analyzed:

1. Work Year Analysis: This analysis will examine the relationship between work years, salary, and remote work ratio. By understanding these factors, individuals and companies can make informed decisions regarding work arrangements and compensation.

2. Experience Level Analysis: This analysis will explore the relationship between experience level, employment type, top three job titles, and company size. Understanding these relationships can help individuals navigate their career paths and guide companies in hiring decisions.

3. Company Location Analysis: This analysis will investigate the relationship between company location and experience level. By examining this relationship, individuals and companies can gain insights into the geographical distribution of data science opportunities.

4. Salary Analysis: This analysis will explore the relationship between salary and various factors such as work year, experience level, company size, job title, and remote work ratio. Understanding these relationships can help individuals negotiate salaries effectively and guide companies in setting competitive compensation packages.

## Conclusion

Through comprehensive exploratory data analysis, this project aims to provide valuable insights and recommendations for individuals and companies interested in the field of data science and data analysis. By understanding the relationships between various factors such as work year, experience level, company location, and salary, stakeholders can make informed decisions that will benefit their careers or organizations.
